        <div class="para1"><p>Narayana Health is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and operates a network of hospitals
          across the country, with a particularly strong presence in the southern state of Karnataka
          and eastern India, as well as an emerging presence in northern, western and central India.
          Our first facility was established in Bengaluru with approximately 225 operational beds and
          we have since grown to 21 Hospitals + 1 Cayman Islands and 6 heart centres, 19 primary car
          facilities across India and an international hospital in the Cayman Islands. The group now 
          features over 5,859 operational beds through a combination of greenfield projects and acquisitions.
          We believe that the "Narayana Health" brand is strongly associated with our mission to deliver 
          high-quality, affordable healthcare services to the broader population by leveraging our 
          economies of scale, skilled doctors, and an efficient business model</p></div>
