    <h2>Angel Institutions For Robotic In India</h2>
    <p>Robotic Surgery is a method to perform surgery using very small tools attached to a robotic arm. The surgeon
        controls the robotic arm with a computer. The surgeon sits at a computer station and directs the movements of a
        robot. Small surgical tools are attached to the robot’s arms. Surgery can be performed through smaller cuts than
        open surgery. The small, precise movements that are possible with this type of surgery give it huge advantages
        over standard surgical techniques. This can allow the surgeon to do a procedure through a small cut that could
        be done before only with open surgery.

        The Apollo Institute of Robotic Surgery is considered to be the best hospital for robotic surgery in India and
        is committed to providing patients with exceptional clinical outcomes. The state-of-the-art operating theatres
        are equipped with the da Vinci® surgical system, the most advanced platform for minimally invasive surgery
        available today. The four-armed surgical robotic system is a breakthrough in surgical technology and is used in
        the specialties of Urology, Gynaecology, Cardiac, Gastrointestinal surgery, Bariatrics and Paediatrics. Robotic
        surgery for treatment of prostate, kidney and urinary bladder cancer has proved to be highly beneficial to
        patients.</p>
