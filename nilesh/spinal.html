              <h4>Spondylosis</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) or Spondylosis refers to the gradual deterioration of the disc between the vertebrae
                 in the backbone. This disease is very common, and affects as much as 40-50% of people over the age of 40. The
                  disorder also becomes increasingly common as we age. It is a disease of wear and tear similar to osteoarthritis. 
                  It commonly happens in the lumbar spine (low back), though it can occur at any spinal level.

                In DDD, the discs get flattened, losing their normal height. This disc height is what separates the disc above from the
                 one below. Nerve pathways may become narrowed and cause nerve impingement, inflammation, and pain, when the disc
                  height is lost.
                
                Degenerated discs become much thinner and sometimes the vertebrae also develop small, rough areas which irritate the 
                nearby nerves. Severe neck pain and stiffness and pain down the arms and hands can result from this .
                
                Medication and exercises are the first line of management.
                
                Cervical spondylosis is a very common condition where there is chronic degeneration of the bones of the
                 neck (cervical spine) and the cushions between the vertebrae (inter vertebral disc). This is managed by cervical
                  spine surgery where the worn out discs or bone spurs are removed â€“ depending on the underlying problem. Sometimes 
                  the gap would be filled by a graft of bone or other implants made of metal combined with bone.</p>
                  <h4>Slipped Disc</h4>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Slipped disc is a common term used to refer to a prolapsed disc. This is a disorder when the inner, softer part
                     of the disc bulges out through a weakness in the outer part of the disc. The bulging disc may then press on 
                     nearby nerves and cause discomfort and pain. Back pain, ache in the arm or leg and pinpricks felt in 
                     feet, toes and hands are the usual symptoms.</p>
                     <h4>Spondylolisthesis</h4>
                     <hr>
                     <p>The Greek term for slipping of the spine is Spondylolisthesis . The Greek term for slipping of the spine is
                         Spondylolisthesis. This term refers to the abnormal forward movement of one vertebra over the one below. It is
                          in the lumbar spine that this forward slip of the vertebra happens most often. Pressure on the nerve roots
                           associated with the affected vertebrae, as well as pain and dysfunction are caused by the slippage and
